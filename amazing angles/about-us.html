                <p> <strong>Dear Parents, Students, and Well-Wishers,</strong><br>
                  I extend a warm welcome to you on behalf of the Amazing Angels Public School family. It is with immense pleasure and pride that I share a glimpse of our school's ethos and commitment to education.<br>

        <strong>Ms. Nargis Shaikh</strong><br>
        <strong>Principal</strong><br>

            <h2>Rules & discipline</h2>
            <p>Punctuality is paramount, and all students are expected to arrive on time. The school gate closes 15 minutes after the prayer bell, and no late entries will be allowed after that. Students consistently arriving late on more than two days in a month will be kindly sent back upon their arrival. <br>
                Regular attendance is essential for academic success. Absences exceeding three days due to medical reasons will be excused only with the submission of a medical certificate from a registered practitioner. The school management may impose a fine for unexplained absences, with each day requiring proper documentation and parental consent.<br>
                To maintain academic eligibility, students must achieve an attendance rate of at least 75% in each term. A commitment to a clean, well-pressed uniform is mandatory, and failure to adhere to personal hygiene and cleanliness standards will result in fines.<br>
                Adherence to all school rules, teacher instructions, and a proactive approach to class and homework is non-negotiable. Indifferent attitudes towards studies, school activities, or instructions will not be tolerated. In cases of persistent rule violations, setting a negative example, the school reserves the right to remove such students from enrollment. We believe that a disciplined environment is crucial for a thriving educational community, and we appreciate the cooperation of both students and parents in maintaining these standards.<br>
            </p>
            
            <h2>Admission</h2>
            <p>For admission to the School, children should be around 3 years of age for Class Nursery. The admission process for the academic session commences on April 1st. It is imperative that application forms are completed accurately and signed before submission. All necessary documents must be annexed to the application form, and any incorrect or false information provided will result in automatic disqualification. The School reserves the right to refuse admission without specifying a reason. <br>
                Upon receiving an application for admission to Class 1, the applicant, following the form's due scrutiny, may be asked to complete the admission process by paying the fees and submitting the required documents. Seats reserved under the Right to Education Act 2009 for the poor and economically weaker sections are available, subject to government criteria and school rules. <br>
                Applicants seeking admission to Class II to Class VIII may undergo a test to determine the appropriate grade. The test date and time will be provided at the time of submitting the completed admission form. After the test results are declared, parents are required to complete all admission formalities within 7 days. <br>
                The new session begins on April 1st. Parents who complete admission formalities are advised to purchase books and stationery by March 31st and send their wards to school on April 1st to avoid academic loss. <br>
